* For the first section of this course, Grad Stats I, I developed lectures that focused on understanding regression models with categorical predictors from the General Linear Model perspective.
* For the second section of this course, Grad Stats II, I developed lectures that focused on understanding regression models that used a combination of both continuous and categorical predictors, running regression diagnostics, and performing mixed effects models.
* Throughout both courses, weekly hands-on labs were administered to guide students on how to perform a variety of data analysis techniques using R.
