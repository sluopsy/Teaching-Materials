# Teaching Materials
 
* Grad Stats I
  + For this course, I developed lectures that focused on understanding regression models with categorical predictors from the General Linear Model perspective
    
* Grad Stats II
  + In this course, I developed lectures that focused on understanding regression models that used a combination of both continuous and categorical predictors, running regression diagnostics, and performing mixed effects models.
 
* Data Analysis in R Labs
  + Throughout both courses, weekly hands-on labs were administered to guide students on how to perform a variety of data analysis techniques using R.
